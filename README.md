Task Manager for Teams - Bianca Neagos 931

As a manager, I know how busy my team members are, so I need an app to help them manage their task better.
The app should be secure, prior using it each user must authenticate.
The user should be able to view his tasks, to add new ones and to modify or delete existing ones.
The user should be able to see what percentage of tasks have completed and how much is left to do.
As manager, the user should be able to add tasks to his team, while other members can only manage theirs.
